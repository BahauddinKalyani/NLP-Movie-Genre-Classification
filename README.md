# Movie Genre Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for movie genre classification. The goal is to predict the genre of a movie based on its attributes. The models used include XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Class imbalance is addressed by utilizing class weights during the training process.

## Project Overview

- Perform movie genre classification using XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
- Handle class imbalance by applying class weights to the models.
- Evaluate the models using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
- Provide reproducible code and documentation for future reference.
